Optimization algorithms for machine learning

Supervised learning: Gradient descent algorithms (full, stochastic,
stochastic average), Coordinate descent, path-following algorithms
(LARS, SVMpath, clusterpath), Support vector machines/duality, SMO
algorithm. Linear and quadratic programming, disciplined convex
programming. Greedy algorithms (decision tree growing, forward
stepwise regression).

Unsupervised learning: K-means, Mixture models, EM algorithm, Hidden
Markov models (forward-backward, Baum-Welch, Viterbi), Optimal
changepoint detection (dynamic programming) versus greedy binary
segmentation.

The main evaluation of the class would be 4-5 C/C++ projects where the
students code the optimization algorithms.
